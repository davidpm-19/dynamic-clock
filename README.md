## ðŸ“„ About this Component

What should I say, sometimes you find yourself bored, but really bored, and two neurons connect to create a mini-project, well, this is the result of that wonderful moment, a classic SVG of a clock but with dynamic hour and minute hands with the power of **ANGLES**

## ðŸ’» Features

- **Customizable Appearance:** Parametrized Colors for every item on the SVG and controls to avoid color troubles...cause white on white may work for Kazimir Malevich but not in web components
* **Math Powered Hands:** Why create a new version of something as boring as a static SVG...that's not cool, not fancy, lucky for us maths allow us to do amazing things and also useless project as a pseudo-animated SVG

## ðŸ”¨ Usage

Honestly I don't know if this has a use...but I wanted to do it so go to the [component code](src/Component/dynamic-clock.tsx), slap that copy button and paste it wherever you want, cause if you found a use for this sleepless project you must have been chosen by the universe to use it
